//! Hold a live slice of a Recached cache in your own process.
//!
//! `recached-edge` lets a browser keep a local copy of the cache and receive
//! pushes when it changes. This crate is the same thing for a Rust service:
//! reads come from local memory, and the WebSocket carries only writes out and
//! change notices in.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # async fn demo() -> Result<(), recached_embed::Error> {
//! use recached_embed::Cache;
//!
//! let cache = Cache::connect("ws://127.0.0.1:6380").await?;
//!
//! // Declare the working set once, at start-up. Returns after the initial
//! // state has landed, so the first request never races hydration.
//! cache.watch("fare:*").await?;
//!
//! // Hot path: no network, no await, no lock.
//! let fare = cache.get("fare:MNL-CEB")?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! Small, hot, shared, read-heavy, **slowly-changing** data: fare tables,
//! feature flags, tenant settings, entitlement checks, rate-limit tiers. The
//! win is that a read costs a pointer chase instead of a round-trip, while the
//! server still tells every instance the moment something changes.
//!
//! It is the wrong tool for data that changes constantly (live counters, seat
//! inventory), working sets that do not fit in each process, keys read once, or
//! anything where being stale by milliseconds is unacceptable. Use the server
//! directly for those.
//!
//! # Hydration is part of the contract
//!
//! The local store holds only what your [`watch`](Cache::watch) patterns
//! hydrated. Reading anything else returns [`Error::NotHydrated`] rather than
//! `None`, because a silent `None` is indistinguishable from "the key does not
//! exist" — which is how an embedded cache serves confidently wrong answers.
//! [`get_or_fetch`](Cache::get_or_fetch) is the escape hatch when you would
//! rather pay for a round-trip than declare a pattern.
//!
//! # What survives an outage, and what does not
//!
//! Writes issued while the socket is down are queued **in memory** and
//! replayed on reconnect; they return [`Error::Disconnected`] in the meantime,
//! meaning unacknowledged rather than lost. Two limits on that, both
//! deliberate and both worth sizing for:
//!
//! - The queue is capped ([`CacheBuilder::max_pending`]). Past the cap the
//!   *oldest* queued write is discarded, counted in
//!   [`pending_dropped`](Cache::pending_dropped) and logged at `WARN`.
//! - The queue does not outlive the process. A pod that restarts mid-outage
//!   loses whatever it had queued. The browser SDK backs the same queue with
//!   IndexedDB; there is no equivalent here.
//!
//! Local reads keep working throughout — they just stop receiving updates, so
//! check [`is_connected`](Cache::is_connected) if staleness matters. On
//! reconnect each live query is re-hydrated from a fresh snapshot, and keys the
//! snapshot no longer carries are dropped locally, so a delete or expiry that
//! happened during the outage is not served afterwards.
